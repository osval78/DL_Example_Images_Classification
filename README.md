# AIAQUAMI-EPT33 Training Scripts
Training scripts for the AIAQUAMI-EPT33 dataset size and balance experiments

## Prerequisites
- The training process relies on TensorFlow 2.9.3. 
- To be able to use TensorFlow 2.9.3 on GPU you must first install CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 11.2.
- After setting up CUDA and cuDNN, install the project requirements listed in <code>[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)</code> file.

## Train model on a custom dataset
1) Create a root folder for the dataset and place extracted dataset images into <code>data/data_original</code> subfolder. 
2) In <code>[settings.py](settings.py)</code> change value for <code>root_folder</code> variable to appropriate value.
3) Reset <code>experiment_no</code> to 1 and select appropriate dataset configuration (<code>subset_distribution</code> and <code>data_sub_folder</code> parameters) in <code>[settings.py](settings.py)</code>.
4) In the case of the dataset balance experiment, in addition, please check <code>balance_dataset</code> parameter in <code>[settings.py](settings.py) that controls internal class balancing.
5) Run <code>[prepare_data.py](prepare_data.py)</code> script to resize images and divide them into train, validation, and test subsets.
6) Run <code>[train.py](train.py)</code> to train the model and generate confusion matrices. 
Results will be saved to <code>tmp</code> dataset subfolder. 
7) In case training crushes due to lack of memory, reduce <code>batch_size</code> and repeat training.
8) Once training is finished, you may find results in <code>tmp</code> folder, under the current experiment subfolder.
